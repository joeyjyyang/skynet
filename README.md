# skynet

Software architecture for personal (semi-)autonomous robot project.

IMPORTANT: Source (setup) bash file located in the /devel directory of the catkin workspace, using `source ./devel/setup.bash`, before running ROS commands!

NOTE: This repo currently contains the entire catkin workspace of the project, including all relevant ROS packages. The workspace will likely be cleaned up in the future and ROS packages will be separately maintained within different repos.
